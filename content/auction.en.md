  <img src="/assets/images_auction/IMG_3940.jpg" class="auction-img" alt="Desk Chair">
  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🪑 Desk Chair</h3>
    <p>Our faithful desk companion for the last 6 years. A little worn, a little creaky, but still cozy and full of character. Perfect for a second life in a cozy corner.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🧰 The 5-Legged Desk</h3>
    <p>This mighty 2-meter IKEA desk has stood strong for 6 years — through work, Zoom calls, and countless coffees. With its unique 5-patas stability, it’s more than just a table — it’s a legend.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🧺 Iron + Ironing Board</h3>
    <p>For those of you who still believe in dressing sharp — or should start doing so. Includes a reliable iron and foldable board, so you can finally stop showing up in those wrinkled clothes you've been pretending are “casual chic”.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🌬️ The Survivor Fan</h3>
    <p>Can’t be elevated, but doesn’t need to — this floor/desk fan is a beast. It got us through the brutal Madrileñan summers with nothing but an ice bottle in front and dreams of A/C. Ultra powerful, ultra loyal. Instant 2000s summer vibes guaranteed.</p>

<div class="auction-item even">
  <img src="/assets/images_auction/IMG_3944.jpg" class="auction-img" alt="Basketball">
  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🏀 San Nicasio Ball</h3>
    <p>This basketball has seen legendary 1v1s between Caterina and me at the San Nicasio court. It's currently a bit deflated and looks rough — but pump it up and it's game-ready for your next 5v5 at uni. Full of street memories and mid-range magic.</p>

  <img src="/assets/images_auction/IMG_3945.jpg" class="auction-img" alt="Zoom Mirror">
  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🔍 Zoom-In Zoom-Out Mirror</h3>
    <p>The ultimate pimple-popper’s ally or makeup artist’s tool. One side normal, the other brutally honest. Just the mirror is for sale — not the two beautiful faces that may appear in the reflection.</p>

<div class="auction-item even">
  <img src="/assets/images_auction/IMG_3946.jpg" class="auction-img" alt="Toilet Shelf">
  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🧴 Toilet Shelves (x2)</h3>
    <p>Only one is shown in the pic, but you’re getting two! These trusty bathroom shelves have held all our beauty essentials — creams, sprays, secrets. Maybe, just maybe, they’ll make you as beautiful as us. No promises, but worth a shot.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🪣 Mop Bucket</h3>
    <p>Yes, it’s the cheapest one from Carrefour. No frills, no wheels, just pure cutre functionality. But hey — it’s helped us clean a lot of memories (and floors). Make your mop feel at home.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🪑 The Legendary Stool</h3>
    <p>This humble stool has done it all — lifted Caterina to the top shelves and moonlighted as Alex’s nightstand for 6 years of late-night YouTube binges. A true multitasker for short people and lazy nights alike.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>👕 Drying Rack Deluxe (Bazar Edition)</h3>
    <p>The classic no-frills drying rack from your local bazar. It’s not fancy, it’s not sturdy, but it dries clothes like a champ. Foldable, functional, and full of memories of laundry days on the terraza.</p>
