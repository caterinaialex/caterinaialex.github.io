  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🪑 Desk Chair</h3>
    <p>Our faithful desk companion for the last 6 years. A little worn, a little creaky, but still cozy and full of character. Perfect for a second life in a cozy corner.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🧰 The 5-Legged Desk</h3>
    <p>This mighty 2-meter IKEA desk has stood strong for 6 years — through work, Zoom calls, and countless coffees. With its unique 5-patas stability, it’s more than just a table — it’s a legend.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🧺 Iron + Ironing Board</h3>
    <p>For those of you who still believe in dressing sharp — or should start doing so. Includes a reliable iron and foldable board, so you can finally stop showing up in those wrinkled clothes you've been pretending are “casual chic”.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🌬️ The Survivor Fan</h3>
    <p>Can’t be elevated, but doesn’t need to — this floor/desk fan is a beast. It got us through the brutal Madrileñan summers with nothing but an ice bottle in front and dreams of A/C. Ultra powerful, ultra loyal. Instant 2000s summer vibes guaranteed.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🏀 San Nicasio Ball</h3>
    <p>This basketball has seen legendary 1v1s between Caterina and me at the San Nicasio court. It's currently a bit deflated and looks rough — but pump it up and it's game-ready for your next 5v5 at uni. Full of street memories and mid-range magic.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🔍 Zoom-In Zoom-Out Mirror</h3>
    <p>The ultimate pimple-popper’s ally or makeup artist’s tool. One side normal, the other brutally honest. Just the mirror is for sale — not the two beautiful faces that may appear in the reflection.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🧴 Toilet Shelves (x2)</h3>
    <p>Only one is shown in the pic, but you’re getting two! These trusty bathroom shelves have held all our beauty essentials — creams, sprays, secrets. Maybe, just maybe, they’ll make you as beautiful as us. No promises, but worth a shot.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🪣 Mop Bucket</h3>
    <p>Yes, it’s the cheapest one from Carrefour. No frills, no wheels, just pure cutre functionality. But hey — it’s helped us clean a lot of memories (and floors). Make your mop feel at home.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🪑 The Legendary Stool</h3>
    <p>This humble stool has done it all — lifted Caterina to the top shelves and moonlighted as Alex’s nightstand for 6 years of late-night YouTube binges. A true multitasker for short people and lazy nights alike.</p>

  <img src="/assets/images_auction/IMG_3949.jpg" class="auction-img" alt="Drying Rack">
  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>👕 Drying Rack Deluxe (Bazar Edition)</h3>
    <p>The classic no-frills drying rack from your local bazar. It’s not fancy, it’s not sturdy, but it dries clothes like a champ. Foldable, functional, and full of memories of laundry days on the terraza.</p>

<div class="auction-item even">
  <img src="/assets/images_auction/IMG_3950.jpg" class="auction-img" alt="Shoe Rack / Plant Stand">
  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🌿 The Shoe Rack That Found Itself</h3>
    <p>Originally a humble zapatero, this piece had a glow-up and now proudly serves as a plant stand. Sturdy, minimal, and versatile — use it for shoes, plants, books, or existential reinvention. (Plants not included — they’re auctioned separately, sorry! 💸)</p>

<div class="auction-item odd">
  <img src="/assets/images_auction/IMG_3951.jpg" class="auction-img" alt="Palo de Brasil #1">
  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🌴 Palo de Brasil #1</h3>
    <p>Tropical vibes with zero effort. This beautiful green friend thrives on neglect — just water it when the soil feels dry: around once a week in summer and every 2–3 weeks in winter. It’s the ultimate chill plant for people who forget they own plants.</p>

<div class="auction-item even">
  <img src="/assets/images_auction/IMG_3952.jpg" class="auction-img" alt="Syngonium (Singonio)">
  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🌿 The Mighty Singonio</h3>
    <p>This is not just a plant — it’s a lifestyle. A tropical Syngonium that’s huge, gorgeous, and endlessly generous. Cut a leaf, stick it in water, and boom: now you have two. She’s a fast grower and might need a transplant soon. Loves frequent watering (once a week) and misting (every day if you're a good parent), but survives even if you're not. Absolute queen of the jungle vibes.</p>

  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🌴 Palo de Brasil #2 (a.k.a. Survivor)</h3>
    <p>This one’s got a story. It once looked like a lush tropical plant — then Ramiro babysat it. Now it resembles a palm tree and carries the wisdom of survival. Still thriving, still chill: water when the soil’s dry, weekly in summer, every 2–3 weeks in winter. If it made it through Ramiro, it'll make it through anything.</p>

<div class="auction-item even">
  <img src="/assets/images_auction/IMG_3954.jpg" class="auction-img" alt="Dracaena Reflexa Angustifolia">
  <div class="auction-info">
    <h3>🌳 The Giant Dracaena</h3>
    <p>The biggest plant in the house — and the one that owns the room. A <em>Dracaena reflexa angustifolia</em> that stands (almost) 1 meter tall (we didn’t measure, but trust the vibes). Needs almost no care: water only when the soil is dry. In spring it sheds a few leaves to come back stronger, like a phoenix with foliage. Total elegance, zero drama.</p>
