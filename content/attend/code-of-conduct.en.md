# Code of Conduct

As we gather to celebrate the union of Àlex and Caterina, we are committed to creating an environment where everyone feels welcome, respected, and comfortable. To ensure this, we have established a Code of Conduct for all guests attending our wedding. This code applies to all interactions at the wedding venue, including conversations, celebrations, and any social media posts related to our event.

## Our Commitment

We strive to create a safe and positive experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of wedding participants in any form.

## Expected Behavior

- Respect the boundaries and personal space of others.
- Be mindful of your language and avoid making discriminatory jokes or comments.
- Listen actively and appreciate others' viewpoints.
- Celebrate and embrace diversity and inclusivity.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Physical or verbal abuse of any guest, staff, or other wedding participants.
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning conduct.

## Reporting

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a designated staff member as soon as possible. All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

## Enforcement

Guests violating these rules may be asked to leave the wedding at the discretion of the wedding organizers, without a refund if applicable.
