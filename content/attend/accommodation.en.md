# Accommodation

As you prepare to join us for our special day in Mallorca, we want to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. September is a popular time in Mallorca, and as a result, hotel prices can be quite high. To help you manage your travel budget better, we recommend considering Airbnb as an alternative. Sharing an Airbnb with 4-5 people can be a cost-effective way to enjoy your stay.
